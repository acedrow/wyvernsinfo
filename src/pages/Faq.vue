        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <h3>What is Minnesota Armored Combat?</h3>
        <p>Minnesota Armored Combat (MNAC) is a not-for-profit steel-fighting organization with the goal of promoting
            our
            sport throughout the state of Minnesota. MNAC currently organizes two teams: the Twin Cities Wyverns open
            division team and The Flowers of Battle women's division team.</p>

        <h3>What is Armored Combat?</h3>

        <p>Armored Combat (also known as Buhurt - from an old French word meaning 'to wallop') is a combat sport in
            which
            fighters don historically accurate armor to engage in melee battles using blunted weapons. Our fights are
            full-contact, full-speed, and entirely unscripted.</p>

        <h3>Are there rules?</h3>

        <p>Safety is a big concern for us. As such, fighters are barred from thrusting with their weapons. Joint locks
            and
            any strikes to the feet, knees, groin, or neck are likewise forbidden. There are a number of leagues with
            different regulations, but our events generally conform to the <a
                href="https://www.buhurtinternational.com/">Buhurt International</a> ruleset.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I hire the Wyverns for my event?</h3>

        <p>Yes! We can put on a show for events of all shapes and sizes. Whether you just want a few small demo fights,
            or
            a headline tournament of 20 knights, we've got you covered. Our shows are family-friendly, informative, and
            most
            of all, exciting! </p> <br>

        <p>If you want to get even closer to the action, inquire about our knight experience! After a crash course in
            buhurt basics, we'll get you and your party armored up so you can try your hand at armored combat! Perfect
            for
